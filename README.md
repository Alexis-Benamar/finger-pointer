# finger-pointer

>_a joke, mostly._

My goal with this little project was to learn more about React & React Hooks, `useEffect()` and `useRef()` in particular. So, naturally, I reproduced, with a slight interactivity twist, a [dead twitter meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cascading-pointing-hand-emoji-copypasta).

## Setup

This was made using `create-react-app`. To install it, simply clone the project, then run the following commands:

```
yarn
```

This will install all the required dependencies. Then, once finished, run:

```
yarn start
```
